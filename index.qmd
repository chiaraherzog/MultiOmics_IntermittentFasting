Code repository for TG figures and exploratory analysis code.

## Helper functions and prep

These pages describe big scripts run over all variables and save the outputs. This means models are standardised and outputs can be pulled from the saved scripts.

Examples include:

* [correlation of variables with age at baseline](helper-corr-age-at-baseline.qmd)
* [Wilcoxon tests over all variables](helper-wilcoxon-tests.qmd)
* [linear mixed models over all variables](helper-lmm.qmd)
* [repeated measures correlation](helper-rmcorr.qmd)
